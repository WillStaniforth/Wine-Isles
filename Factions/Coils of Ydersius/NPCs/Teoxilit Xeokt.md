A formerly-aarakocra pureblood, Xeokt was the closest thing to a friend Xym could have claimed in the Ydersian military. A hunter and scout by role, Xeokt taught Xym how to fight with a bow, and always kept her informed of any interesting flora or fauna in the nearby area. In combat, Xeokt would flank the enemy from behind, sowing confusing with a hail of arrows before vanishing into the jungle; a technique Xym is curious to improve upon.
