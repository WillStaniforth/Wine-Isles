A halfling Xilit in New Sydrixus, Peffee was a menial assigned to the laboratories where Xsymmalaxitrixz began her journey, and was the first to shorten her name to Xym. Having been captured from the newly-established Freewind Flotilla, he became Xymâ€™s primary source of information on the cultures of the Wine Isles; she particularly delighted in his tales of pirates and the Hurricane Kings. When Xym began her experiments into hemocraft, Peffee unwillingly became her first and most prized test subject. While she lamented (in her own way) the discomfort and pain she caused him, she promised him that he would be the herald of a new age - the next step upon the evolution of yuan-ti perfection. Now banished from the Coils, Xym regrets that she was not able to bring him with her.
