Arinor Coliana holds the position of Archon, an esteemed apprentice to the Archmage Fandrel. After spending years of study beneath the archmage and not gaining much progress, she began looking for other sources of power. On a trip to the Wine Isles in 753, she makes a pact with the Keeper of the Depths. For the past four years, she has been funnelling a great amount of confidential information about the Gilded Scales and Maltha to the Keeper.


Archon Coliana is a Sorceress of considerable power through her connection to the Keeper.

In 753, the Archon was engaged in a losing conflict against Stockard Whitemane and his forces. Whilst engaging in an arcane artillery strike, she was struck from the air by errant cannonfire. She sank into the unfathomable depths of Secinia Abyssal. While unconscious, the keeper of the depths reached out to her thoughts and offered a pact. In exchange for her life, she would offer her undying servitude to the keeper. She would offer it secrets of the Gilded Scales and act as a powerful pawn for the keeper in exchange for greater power.

In the years since, she has gained considerable arcane power from the keeper and worked her way into a figure of prominence within the Wine Isles. She is officially stationed in Andaceres, but spends much of her time aboard the Twilit Lance researching Secinia's tomb.
