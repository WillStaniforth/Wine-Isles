Captain of the Gilded Scales merchant vessel, the Heron’s Wing, Sartori’s skill as a swordsman raises questions about his past not easily answered by the life of a simple trader he leads. A close trading partner of New Sydrixus, known to Xsymmalaxitrixz from her days manufacturing narcotics as part of the Coils’ foreign destabilisation programme. Sartori refused to give aid to the fleeing malison, instead cutting her throat and tossing her overboard as “a show of good faith” to his partners.
