A Half-black dragon lanternbearer and Captain of the Legendary Vespertine.







Cursed millennia ago for SOMETHING, they have spent an eternity sailing the Sea of Nightmare, only being able to spend the sunsets sailing the seas of the Wine Isles they so love.

In 743, after so long sailing the Sea of Nightmare, desperate to end his torment, he reached out for Valiel. Intrigued by his plight and his wish to seek redemption, she struck a deal. If he swears an oath to Valiel that he would spend his time within the material plane seeking out wrong doers and pushing them towards the path of the light, she would grant his freedom after 10,000 redeemed souls. 





Legends say that many millenia ago, the Queen of Secinia gazed upon the heavens above and desired more than her mortal means could allow. 

She pled with Shelyn, let the two of them swap places for one night so that she could bask upon the beauty of the palace of Secinia, truly the jewel of mortal work. But Shelyn would not, "the heavens are not a sight for mortals", she told the queen. 

But the queen did not give in. She next reasoned with Shelyn, let the two of them swap places for one night so that Shelyn could partake in mortal wants and desires, the food, the drink, and the pleasures of the palace. But again, Shelyn refused, "I have the food, the drink, and the pleasures of the gods", she told the queen.

Finally, the queen tried something crafty. From the top of the tallest tower of the palace, she told Shelyn of the scar on one of the moons that could only be seen from her tower. She bargained to let them swap places for just one night so Shelyn could see this flaw and fix such a beautiful thing as the moon. This time, Shelyn agreed.

And so, the queen was swapped to the heavens for just one night. And that night she took it all in. The sight of the heavens was more beautiful than anything the queen had ever seen. The food, the drink, and the pleasures of the heavens were richer and more satisfying than anything she had experienced in the palace of Secinia. And as the night came and went, the two of them eventually swapped back.

But, after the queen returned, she found that she had been tricked. The palace of Secinia, the most beautiful place in the world was now...drab, and dull. The food and drink like ash in her mouth. And she could find no pleasure in anything.
