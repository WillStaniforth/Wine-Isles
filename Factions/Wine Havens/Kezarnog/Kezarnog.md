Physical Features 
Built into a volcanic Caldera, a tavern at the peak 

On the inside of the upper caldera, rows of twisting, hard black iron grape vines form a maze. Pipes from below carry the boiling hot water the grapes need, sprinklers constantly coat them in a deadly hot mist. 

A winding covered ramp spirals around the volcano, ending around halfway up at a copper double drawbridge that spans the caldera. Catapults sit ready to knock attackers off the bridge. At the base of the caldera a workspace has been carved, forges, smelters and kilns use magma to power Rustfeet's mundane industry. Sea water is channeled in from aqueducts to three huge copper cauldrons, the boiling sea water turns three great steam turbines (named Smige, Egeanin and Mohg, after the three first Brew mistresses of rustfeet). These turbines pump fresh water from underground up to the vineyard. 

Notable locations 
Floor 6: The Peak of Hubris, Tavern at the peak, overlooking the cauldron. It is half carved, half built from marble. Glass flooring over the caldera lights the tavern with an eery orange glow. A petrified statue of a tabaxi bard sits at the bar, frozen in a toast. (A victim of a deadly eruption in the tavern's past) Patrons always included him in any toast they make, for luck. Various statues and frescoes decorate the tavern, with plaques detailing it's storied history. Notably: A tarnished copper statue of a dwarven innkeeper, a crying human woman kneeled in prayer, she appears to have suffered a bite wound. A frescoe depicts the first battle of rustfeet, dwarves repelling an attack from undead and horrible experiments, lead by a ratfolk wizard. Notably, access to he floors below from the tavern has been sealed, to visit the tavern, one must make a long climb up the winding spiral ramp, outside. 

Floor 5: The Stompery Dwarves in heavy iron boots crunch on the hard iron shells of the iron grapes, the juicy insides are strained from the shell remains to make Rustfeet's famous vintage. The iron shells remains are sent via minecart to Floor 1. 

Floor 4: The Falia Oshmokones memorial temple A multi faith temple with a huge statue, a crying human woman kneeled in prayer, she appears to have suffered a bite wound. Also on this floor a more specific temple to the rustfeet patron deity Folgrit, the Watchful Mother. Accomodation for the various clergy. 

Floor 3: Military level, drawbridge. Various barracks, training areas and firing ranges, anybody entering rustfeet must travel through the floor, the main thoroughfare features blade traps, arrow slits and kill zones. 

Floor 2: A warren of rooms for guests and dwarves alike, main accomodation floor, includes a great dining hall, communal baths, hospital, and small tavern, 'the sage adviser'. The throne room of the Current brewmistress is also on this floor, it overlooks the magma pool through a large wrought iron glass window. 

Floor 1: Smeltery and turbines At the base of the caldera a workspace has been carved, forges, smelters and kilns use magma to power Rustfeet's mundane industry. Sea water is channeled in from aqueducts to three huge copper cauldrons, the boiling sea water turns three great steam turbines (named Smige, Egeanin and Mohg, after the three first Brew mistresses of rustfeet). These turbines pump fresh water from underground up to the vineyard. Also on this floor, various guildhalls, one for every industry rustfeet engages in. 

Floor 0: Old fortress Mostly blocked off, this is the original layout of rustfeet, when it was but a simple outpost. Considered uninhabitable due to a magma leak, obsidian blocks bar entry. 

Floor -1: Nobility quarters Freestanding houses built from iron blocks squat in what was a marble quarry. This is where the brewmistress, and the chairmen of the bard live. A nicer hospital, tavern and chapel are housed here, the walls are carved with elaborate images. 

Floor -2: Freshwater spring. Pumps carry water from here to level 1 

Floor -3: Under fort and Dungeon Defenses from underground threats are housed here, the underguard have a rivalry with the army on Floor 3: Driving them both to devise more and more elaborate defenses and traps. The dungeon (prison) is housed here. 

Floor -4: Rofei Pasture. An underground fungal pasture, walled off from the rest of the underdark (hastily, from the look of it) houses the livestock of rustfeet. Rofei and cave turkey graze lazily in the pitch blackness. 

Floor-5: Mines, and below. A Huge steel portcullis separates the mine and its porential dangers from the dwarves above.
