**Peak of Hubris:**

Dr Erben Bilcorin awaits his friend Athena Drake here, to set out on a new adventure. Unbenknownst to him, she isn't coming. The letter he sent was intercepted by the Red Tower goblins, and found by the party. He believes that he's pinpointed the lair of whatever is looting and sinking ships, and with the help of an expedition party would be able to recover the loot. He also has suspicions that somebody working at the docks at Rustfeet might have something to do with the ships disappearances, as every ship that goes missing visits Rustfeet at some point along it's journey.



Khazmok Stouteye is the dwarven trader that has been supplying shipments with Kez's Dogs. He is unaware of exactly what is happening, he is simply being paid to collect shipments from Kez, and spread them in throughout other shipments. He is being paid the bulk of the money Kez is making, Kez simply wants more people to experiment on.
