Brewmistress Thombrella Kezarnog is a stout and hardy woman, with thick ginger braided hair and a full ginger beard. She has incredible self-confidence and is usually covered in a layer of ash from the stompery. She sporadically hums old dwarven songs.

Rewards:

If the party offer her the terrarium, she will offer the party full use of Kezarnog's shipyard now and going forwards, as well as 1,000gp worth of upgrades to their vessel. 

If the party offers the location of the unrecovered wine, she will offer the party an extra 1,000gp worth of upgrades to their vessel.

If the party offers the tapestry, she will offer 4,00gp.

Regardless of what the party trade, she will offer to the party an informal agreement to offer them less than scrupulous jobs in the future.
