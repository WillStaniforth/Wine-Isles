Khazmok Stouteye is the dwarven merchant that has been supplying shipments with Kez's Dogs. He is unaware of exactly what is happening, he is simply being paid to collect shipments from Kez, and spread them in throughout other shipments. He is being paid the bulk of the money Kez is making, Kez simply wants more people to experiment on. 

Khazmok lives in a well-furnished home in floor -1. Within his home are the merchant receipts that are evidence of his tampering with crates.

There is a Clockwork Bronze Scout guarding his home.
