***Shipping Routes.*** Kezarnog wants to re-establish trade with the newly-renamed Tecolotl, once the Wine haven Kolimik. The Gilded Scales company, based in Alegria Keep, are maintaining an embargo on Tecolotl and throttling trade through the strait. Thrombrella Kezarnog wants this to change, but needs a privateer to do so that is not seen to be working for the Wine Haven. 

* The primary quest is to destroy the defences at Alegria keep.
* It will be recommended to lure out Commodore Valverde on the Sternhammer first, as with the Sternhammer defending the keep it will be significantly more difficult.

If the party are able to do this, they will be rewarded with 1,000gp for each officer on the ship. If the party are able to capture the Sternhammer, they will also fix it up for them.


***Lost Haven.*** Word on the grapevine is that an entrance to the ruins of Nurgran have been found on the southernmost isle of Bastet's Claws. The old Wine Haven must still be absolutely loaded with treasure since most of it sunk into the sea.
