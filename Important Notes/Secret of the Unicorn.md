"Three brother's joined. Three Unicorns in company sailing in the noonday sunne will speak. For 'tis from the light that light will dawn, and so shines forth the dove's ankh."

There are three models of the legendary ship, the Unicorn. 

One is deep within [[Devil's Cay]], protected by the ice devil Bavrazi.

Another is owned by Thundercloud in the Night, one of the merchant lords of Unarith.

The third was found by Joldir "Granite Joe" Stoneback, a dwarven pirate rotting in Saltiron prison. He will attest that it was sold to [[Captain Shalako]] of the Eyecatcher.
