**Initiative:**
At the start of combat, every ship rolls a Dexterity check to determine initiative, adding its morale to the roll.

**Turn order:**
Officers always take their actions in rank order: Captain, Quartermaster, First Mate, Bosun, Arcanist, Master Gunner, Navigator. In combat, this happens immediately before the start of their ship’s turn. During travel, every officer declares their action first, then takes their actions in the same order.

**Actions:**
Every ship can move and take one action on its turn, with its movement determined by the helmsman and its action selected by the captain. Ships don’t have reactions, but great sea-beasts do.

**Facing**
The most important difference between ship and creature combat is that ships have specific facing. All ships have a fore (front), aft (rear), and sides (port for left and starboard for right). This matters for movement and for combat, as a ship’s weapons generally face specific directions. A ship’s heading is its direction - it can point in any of six directions (or eight, on a rectangular grid). When a ship changes its heading, it’s described in terms of points — each point is one face of a hex, or 60 degrees (45 degrees on a rectangular grid). When a ship fires its weapons, it can only fire in specified arcs, as depicted below.

**Movement**
Unlike creatures, sailing ships are always moving. A ship must move half its speed during its turn, and must always begin its turn by moving one space directly forward. If a ship under sail wants to turn, it must move at least one space straight ahead before it can change its heading by one point. A ship without a captain directing it always moves straight ahead for half its speed.

**Stopped Ships**
Anytime a ship’s speed is greater than 0, it’s moving. A variety of things can reduce a ship’s speed to 0, though. 
A ship can expend half its movement to reef its sails and intentionally reduce its speed to 0.
Its sails or rudder can become severely damaged. 
A colossal creature can grapple it in place. 
A ship with a speed of 0 can change its heading by up to 2 points on its turn. If a ship is big enough to occupy multiple spaces, its bow stays in place while it performs a stationary turn.

**Wind**
If the DM wants to apply simple wind rules, they can roll a d6 to determine which way the wind blows at the start of combat. A ship that moves directly into the wind does so at half speed. A ship that starts or ends its movement pointed directly away from the wind can move an additional 40 feet. At time 20 on every round, the GM can roll a d6 to change the wind direction.
