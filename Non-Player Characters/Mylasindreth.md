Mylasindreth, or Mylas for short, is a young bronze dragon who resides within the Wine Isles. He is the youngest child of Ordu, the Tender, and has recently left the next to travel. He has no permanent location he calls his lair, but hopes to one day charter a ship to call his own.

Mylas roams the seas of the Wine Isles searching for wealthy vessels to trade with. The three main things he looks for are antiquities, magic items, and room and board on a vessel for a night, but he will always happily trade for gold. He retains all of his valuables within his saddlebag of holding, a gift from his father.

He will usually announce his presence to a vessel by swimming just below the surface of the water so that the sun's reflection from his scales draws the attention of the crew, before surfacing and landing gracefully on the deck.

In his draconic form, he has coppery bronze scales with a white underbelly and wingflaps, reminiscent of the colouration koi carp. His body is long and sinewy, with a large sail that runs down the spine to the tip of the tail. There is just the tinge of green at the base of the sail and wings that show he is beginning to age into the early adulthood stage of his lifespan. Around the base of his neck, he wears what appears to be a saddlebag.

In his humanoid form, he takes the appearance of a young elven man with coppery hair that goes down almost to his shoulders, light tan skin, and green eyes. He wears a swashbuckler's leather jacket with an exposed midriff, and a more ornamental than functional pauldron over his left arm that is decorated with a wave pattern. At his left hip is a sheathed rapier, and at his other hip is a satchel that shares the same design as the saddlebag did in his dragon form.

Each time he visits a ship, he has 3 random magic items up for sale, as well as any rumours he's heard/seen in his travels.
