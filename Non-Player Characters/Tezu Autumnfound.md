Man who taught [[Maxwell Esters]] knife throwing as a party trick, **Tezu autumnfound,** was a gatherer (went to shore for long periods to trade goods). Maxwell can recognise Tezuâ€™s ship from a great distance, having looked out for it for years on land and at sea. If anything happened to this humble, kindly, 106 year old Maxwell would make some very rash decisions. His flag is a field of blue, with two hands holding goods out to one another, one holding wheat, one holding fish.
