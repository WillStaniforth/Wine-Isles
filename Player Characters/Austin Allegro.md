Life Events
Current age: 51—60 years (60 years old)
-60 years to -47 years

Born to proud family of fisherman, in a small coastal town on the northern stretch. When he was 7 years old, he and his best friend were playing in the rock pools in the port town he lived in. Bodes stood on a stonefish and got a large dose of venom. He had a long, drawn out seizure for which he spent weeks recovering in bed. The priests could cure him of the poisoning, but after that point, he suffered from violent mood swings. As a teenager he had difficulty understanding why people acted the way they did, he had no friends, and seemed to barely register with his peers.

-47 years to -40 years

He ran away from home at the age of 13, not even leaving a note. On the road, he joined another young man at a fire, and they talked, they had a lot in common. Eventually, this young man told bodes that he was on his way to start at a prestigious, and highly exclusive bard college in jackhammer. Bodes strangled him in his bed, took his instruments, name and papers, becoming Vitreus Huma. The resulting euphoria of this success awakened his powers of sorcery, his hair turned a blue-ish silver and he had new magical abilities. As well as this, he found that people seemed to like him instinctively now. He had very little difficulty persuading a travelling bard to teach him the lyre as he travelled on foot into Galt.

He managed good but not exceptional grades in Bard college, realising he enjoyed music, it was perhaps the only past time he actively enjoyed. 

-40 years to -28 years

He joined the state evoker’s guild, quickly ascended the command chain and spent 12 years as a faceless middle manager, rarely getting his hands dirty. When he was outed to not be the real Vitreus Huma, he benefited from Octopus guild protection, and they brushed his false identity under the rug.

-28 years to -5 years

During an internal guild conflict, he backed the losing side, realising this just before it was too late, and ratted out his co-conspirators. As a  consequence, he was not kicked out of the guild, but

he was kicked out of Jakhammer, to manage an Octopus guild lodge in the city of Halvon. He steadily worked his way into local politics, during this time, he married for political advantage, sadly, his wife died only a year after their vows. (He did not kill her, but she had an extremely fragile constitution, and the stress of her relationship with him took its toll. 

-5 years

His next marriage to Benedikta Devere proved to be far more stressful to Willem/Vitreus, as his new wife initially seemed similarly dull witted, but proved to be a force to reckoned with behind closed doors. 

-3 years

Willem finally manages to maneuver himself into power, with the help of his politically savvy wife. 

-6 months

His regime collapses due to the combined weight of the collapse of his octopus guild backing, the economic collapse of Halvon, and a full scale revolt from the frustrated citizens of Halvon. Due to his long hidden abilities as a sorcerer, he escaped, and took a new identity, a travelling Bard named Austin Allegro.**
