## Backstory Summary

### Early Backstory

  

- Originally from the Coalheart Orc Tribe within the Northern Stretch
    
- Sought out the Arashi Clan following tales of their recruitment of other Orc Tribes. Joined around the time he came of-age. (Joined Clan 742)
    
- While serving on an Arashi ship, captured during a clash with the Servants of the Light. Transported to one of their fortresses and brought before a recently inducted Lanterbearer.
    
- Chose to swear an oath of redemption, and was branded with an Oathseal. Oath forswore the raising of arms against innocents. (Oath Sworn 744)
    
- Returned to the Arashi shaken by the experience, abided by his sworn word to avoid further dishonor. Worked as a smith and carpenter for the clan, avoiding direct combat. Later worked as bosun across various ships.
    
- Met and later married Hayuma, a Horizonborn Aven who eventually came to captain a ship within the Arashi fleet and was the daughter of two of Zhurok’s initial battalion. (Married 750)
    
- Hayuma was a skilled combatant (relatively speaking), thrill-seeking and bloodthirsty. Burdock was a huge wife-guy about this, and supported her as a Bosun and supplier of weapons. (The Heavy Pistol that became his Forbidden Artifact was definitely an anniversary present to her originally.)
    

- Researched tales of cursed treasure and other supernatural phenomena.
    

  

### Inciting Incident (~ 3 Months Pre-Campaign)

  

- Convinced Hayuma and her crew to sail out to investigate rumors of strange treasures unearthed by a merchant on a small island within the Kersumo Depths.
    
- Rumours were a trap, the crew is attacked by a Servants of The Light vessel led by the same Lanterbearer that Burdock had met 13 years prior.
    
- Once it is clear they cannot escape boarding, he chose to hide away within the depths of the ship rather than fight, too cowardly to face an experienced Lanternbearer.
    
- Emerges after the Servants of the Light have left. Any other members of the crew were killed or captured.
    
- Hayuma had been slain in battle with the Lanterbearer, and her body was beyond any reasonable means of revival (feels like a precaution the Servants of the Light would think to apply).
    
- Consumed by grief and guilt, Burdock draws upon dark powers to infuse both himself and his Forbidden Artifact (Hayuma’s pistol, recovered from the wreckage). As part of this, he channels the lingering fury and malice from Hayuma’s fading spirit as it passes on.
    

  

### Before Session 1

  

- Drifts aimlessly for a while, too guilt-stricken to return to the Arashi. (Ends up in the appropriate area for the start of the campaign.)
    
- Rouses himself from drunken mourning as comes to realise the dark power he had awoken.
