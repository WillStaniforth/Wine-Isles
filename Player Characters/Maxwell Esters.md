Family life

Small family on the flotilla. Only child of a high up member of the Women’s circle. Father Esters was a general/guard when the northern stretch was home. He became one of the first casualties of the gilded scales company. Being 12 at the time, Maxwell Esters was overly mothered and protected by the women’s circle and the flotilla as a whole.

Motivations

The mothering on the flotilla annoys Maxwell no end. In order to be treated like a grown up, he decides to flee the flotillia. He intends to become a feared pirate in the Wine Isles, take some revenge on the Gilded Scales Company, and return to the flotillia respected by his kind and using his reputation and experience as a pirate to protect the freewind halflings.

How get here?

Was captured trying to steal a merchant ship on his own. The merchants captured and took him to the Guilded Scales company when they next made port. This was 3 weeks after leaving the flotilla. Will can decide how long he has been in prison for.

Merchant was transporting odds and sods, fruit, meat, water, table or two.

Important people

Potential freewind flotilla idea: The Halflings have a flag that unites them. Each boat also flies its own flag, reflecting the profession and personality of the captain.

Man who taught Maxwell knife throwing as a party trick, **Tezu autumnfound,** was a gatherer (went to shore for long periods to trade goods). Maxwell can recognise Tezu’s ship from a great distance, having looked out for it for years on land and at sea. If anything happened to this humble, kindly, 106 year old Maxwell would make some very rash decisions. His flag is a field of blue, with two hands holding goods out to one another, one holding wheat, one holding fish.

**[[Calara Esters]],** Mother, is int’ Women’s Circle . The whole women’s circle raised Maxwell, and are very protective of him.

**[[Maealyn]]** is a cousin, she sails the seas as an Envoy and scout of the freewind floatilla. Her ship has some lovely cannons and is very speedy. Her flag is a stripe of green, larger stripe of blue, and a stripe of light-brown/beige representing her role as envoy to the land-livers.

Orc friend, **[[Egharod]],** went to school with him. He joined the arashi clan when he heard that his family was there. He was a great chef, and learned his skills during the exodus.
