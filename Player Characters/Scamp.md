Description: Scamp is a white/grey ratfolk with a black stripe going from her nose and down her back. The fur on the stripe is longer than the rest, and she’s made it into a mohawk. Her black eyes have a dark green sheen to them.

**Backstory:**

Scamp was always destined to be a little troublemaker. From the start, she thrived on mischief and reckless antics. Though she once had a different name, her devious ways—especially her habit of swiping trinkets from the townspeople—earned her the nickname Scamp, and it eventually replaced her real name entirely.

She grew up in a warren with around 80 other Ratfolk, all of whom were related. Scamp might have had anywhere from 10 to 18 siblings, though she could never quite keep track. Truth be told, she wasn’t sure her parents knew the exact number either.

The warren was nestled outside the small port town of Sandwood Harbour, where Scamp became notorious for her pranks. It was also here that she developed a fascination with a local artificer named Bhalmek Graygrace, a dwarven inventor whose creations caught her attention. She often pilfered his gadgets, curious to figure out how they worked. Eventually, Bhalmek caught on and, rather than stopping her, he left a few gadgets out for her to take. One of them trapped Scamp in a sticky substance, allowing Bhalmek to finally catch her, and that was the start of their beautiful friendship.

Bhalmek introduced her to the art of gadget-making, teaching her how to craft things like smoke bombs. He also shared his past with her, revealing that he had studied in Stjora Vinduhn at the House of Greyspine. Scamp became intrigued, not so much by the academic side, but by the potential treasures she could find there.

In 753, the Gilded Scales arrived in Sandwood Harbour. Scamp, as usual, couldn’t resist a little adventure and snuck aboard their flagship, sneaking into the captain’s quarters. After rummaging through his things, she found her greatest prize: The Ball. A silvery sphere, covered in glowing runes and concentric circles, it became her new favorite item—used mostly to hit people in the face.

After swiping the Ball, Scamp returned home, only for Bhalmek to warn her hours later that the Gilded Scales had realized what was missing and were out for blood. They were rounding up the villagers for questioning. In a rare moment of heroism, Scamp teamed up with Bhalmek to create a dramatic distraction, one that allowed the villagers and the warren to escape unscathed. But it also set the Gilded Scales on a new course: after them.

Bhalmek and Scamp spent the next six months on the run, but their luck ran out when they had a brutal encounter with the Gilded Scales and Captain Ludovico Toussant, the very captain Scamp had stolen from. The two had to part ways for their safety, and Scamp set off for Stjora Vinduhn, determined to learn more about the mysterious Ball.

Over the past few years, she’s found creative ways to break into the city’s library in search of information. One of the caretakers, a drow woman named Belarria Din’oryn, has been particularly irritated by Scamp’s antics. But Scamp knows, deep down, that Belarria has grown rather fond of her shenanigans—though she’d never admit it.

**Notable NPCs Scamp Knows:**

·         **Chitter**- Older sister. Blue/grey fur, and always acted like a second mother to Scamp.

·         **Match**- Older brother. Brown fur with patches of white on his arms and back. Jock vibes.

·         **Pipkin**- Mother. White fur with a dusting of grey on her nose. Quiet, kind woman, who is exasperated by Scamp’s behaviour but also wouldn’t change her for the world.

·         **Grizle**- Father. Black fur that’s balding on top of his head. Boisterous with a bellowing laugh. Very talented with a mallet when the need arises. 

·         **Dusty**- Grandmother. A dusty grey furred ratfolk with white eyes. Nobody knows how old she is. She’s the matriarch of the warren, and no one is stupid enough to mess with Grandma Dusty.

·         **Bhalmek Graygrace**- artificer mentor. Dwarven man, with black hair and beard, and weathered tanned skin. Missing an eye that he covers with an old eye patch, and has a mechanical arm because he blew up the last one.

·         **Belarria Din’oryn**- Drow woman who’s a caretaker and scholar from Stjora Vinduhn. Though she hates Scamp for constantly breaking in, she can’t deny that she’s enjoyed the excitement of their strange love/hate “friendship” (she uses that term very lightly). She has dark blue hair, light purple skin, and shining silver eyes. She’s a wizard.

·         **Captain Ludovico Toussant**- This is the Gilded Scales captain that Scamp stole the Ball from. He’s a human man, in his late 30s/early 40s. Clean shaven, grey eyes, dirty blonde haor, and a nasty scar across his chin that was caused by Scamp hitting him in the face with the Ball.
