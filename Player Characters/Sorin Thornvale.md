# Power

As boon mechanically

Lorewise, is a power and burden passed from one guardian to the next via a large druidic rite. At the end of the rite the druid and spirit beast die/pass on. Typically held by one druid for thousands of years. There's been x number of (title), starting with the first druid's, the powers origin is not known to him (upto Will). Other druid's know of the circle/power but not all believe it and those who do believe it maybe don't all respect it or think it would be a power better served in a different capacity as even past (titles) didn't have noticeable impact (due to anonymity rather than lack of action).

# Sorin Backstory

Sorin Thornvale was the youngest of three half-elven sons, born to Harlan and Mirella Thornvale. His older brothers, Daelon and Jareth, 17 and 22 years his senior, were more like uncles than siblings, spending their days working the fields and leaving Sorin to entertain himself. The farm was an hour from the closest village Green Thorpe and a couple days from Theogonia. Though his parents loved him, their time was stretched thin by the demands of the farm, and Sorin often felt like an afterthought in his own family. He found solace in the quiet of the nearby forest.

  

At 14, during one of his many excursions into the woods, Sorin discovered a hidden cave. Its entrance was overgrown with moss and vines, and inside, the air smelled of earth and old magic. Believing it to be abandoned, he claimed it as his own, decorating abandoned shelves and chests with trinkets and crafting rudimentary symbols on the walls. The cave became his refuge—a place where he could escape the isolation he felt at home.  

  

But the cave was not as empty as it seemed. Its true owner, a dwarven druid named Caelthar, returned one evening to find Sorin’s childish scrawlings and rearranged belongings. Outraged, the druid shooed the boy away, but Sorin’s curiosity only grew. He returned again and again, watching from the shadows as Caelthar performed strange rituals and tended to the cave’s natural energies. Over time, Caelthar’s irritation gave way to amusement, and he allowed Sorin to visit, slowly taking the boy under his wing. Caelthar was unlike anyone Sorin had ever met—gruff and wise, with an air of mystery that fascinated the boy. He spoke of distant lands, ancient secrets, and the cycles of life and death that governed all things. For Sorin, who had never traveled beyond the neighboring village, these stories were a revelation. The bond between them deepened, and Caelthar began teaching Sorin simple tasks: identifying herbs, mending wounds, and understanding the forest’s rhythms.  

  

Just before Sorin’s 16th birthday, Caelthar began preparing for a powerful ritual. He grew distant and secretive, revealing little about its purpose but insisting that Sorin assist him. The boy dutifully gathered rare ingredients, memorized incantations, and carved intricate symbols into the stone floor of the cave. The ritual began with a somber air. Caelthar summoned his spirit animal, a radiant stag, and sacrificed it to channel the ritual’s energy. Sorin recoiled in horror, but Caelthar steadied him with a grave look. “This is necessary,” he said. “It is your time now.” Before Sorin could protest, Caelthar turned the ceremonial blade on himself, completing the rite with his own life.  

  

The cave erupted in blinding light, raw magic tearing through Sorin’s body as he was lifted into the air, his screams drowned by the roar of the ritual. When the power subsided, he collapsed, trembling and feverish, barely able to stumble back to the farm. By nightfall, his strength failed entirely, his shallow breaths fading as his family surrounded him in despair. Mirella cradled him, her whispered prayers unanswered, while Harlan stood silent, his grief etched deeply into his face.

As dawn broke, Sorin’s body lay still and lifeless.

  

Two days later, Sorin awoke in the woods near the cave, disoriented and changed. His half-elven body was gone, replaced by the slender taller frame of a wood elf, his youthful appearance now that of a man in his early twenties. As he stumbled to his feet, a movement caught his eye. A fox with silver fur and bright, intelligent eyes sat watching him. It padded closer, its presence steadying him. Somehow, Sorin knew: this was his spirit animal, a piece of himself made flesh.  

  

Stricken with panic, Sorin returned to the cave, desperate for answers. He tore through Caelthar’s belongings, his frantic search uncovering a hidden compartment. Inside, he found a letter addressed to him. It revealed the ritual and mantle of the Unbroken Wheel: a cycle of life, death, and rebirth that granted its bearer the power of reincarnation and a bond to a spirit animal. The letter explained Caelthar’s decision to pass on the mantle, believing Sorin’s innocence would allow him to wield the power with humility and care. Yet, it also warned of the price—Sorin would endure the loneliness of watching loved ones age and die while he remained, bound to the eternal cycle.

  

Shaken and grieving, Sorin returned to his home only to find his family burying his human body. Overcome with despair and confusion, he turned away, unable to face them as the stranger he had become. With little more than Caelthar’s letter and the silent companionship of the fox, Sorin fled toward the nearest port village, driven by equal parts fear and the need to understand his new purpose.  

  

# Travelling backstory

Over the next half a dozen years, Sorin wandered the western coast, drifting from town to town and slowly learning the hard truths of his new existence. He discovered the basics of his powers through trial and error—dying and reincarnating multiple times before understanding the risks of his immortality. 

  

Early in his journey, Sorin, still calling himself Sorin but wearing the face of a Half-Orc, crossed paths with a charismatic merchant named Eryndor, a man whose worldly charm and sharp wit drew the young druid in. Eryndor seemed to understand the world in a way Sorin could not, offering guidance and companionship that felt genuine to the naive wanderer. Eager for connection, Sorin began to see Eryndor as a mentor, someone he could trust. Over time, he shared more than he should have—his struggles with his powers, his rebirths, and even the existence of his spirit animal.

  

The betrayal came when Eryndor led Sorin into a trap, selling him out to a group of mercenaries hunting for rare magical anomalies. Caught off guard, Sorin was cornered and killed while attempting to escape, only to awaken days later in a nearby forest. Beside him lay a serpent, his spirit animal now reborn in a new form, a silent reminder of the lessons his death had taught him. Sorin vowed not to be so trustworthy and foolish again. Never again would he use his real name again, always changing it with each new face. 

  

Alone on the road between towns one night, Sorin sat by a dying campfire, his spirit animal resting quietly nearby. In the stillness, he found himself speaking to it, testing names until one felt right—Kara. Though it made no response, Sorin felt the bond between them deepen, the name marking a sense of companionship in his solitude.

  

A few faces and names came and went as Sorin continued his slow, aimless journey up the western coast, eventually arriving at the northernmost point: Morazhar Bay, known as “Dark Echo” in Dwarvish, and the nearby Kazad’varkun, or Bayrock Isle to non-dwarves. The isle was home to a quarry of rare veinstar marble, an abandoned prison from a long-defunct dwarven regime, and Durak-Tor, a bustling port city with a blend of dwarves and travelers from all over.

  

Sorin, now going by the dwarven alias Odric Zargrithaz, settled on the isle for over a year, unsure of his next steps. He split his time between working for a fishing crew led by the hearty and no-nonsense Guldrim Thalzund and helping out at a merchant shop run by Guldrim’s shrewd partner, Kelvar Khrundak. Sorin quickly became a valued employee and, more importantly, a trusted drinking companion. For the first time in years, he felt a genuine bond with others—a connection he knew he could never reclaim if his secret was revealed. Determined to preserve these friendships even beyond death, he devised a plan to create a false sense of trust among future faces.

  

Inspired by the tattoos of the sailors passing through the port, each with their own stories and meanings, Sorin invented a “secret group.” Purchasing a tattoo kit from a departing sailor, he spent weeks learning the craft. Eventually, he tattooed a simple, runic-looking swirl onto his inner arm. He showed it to Guldrim and Kelvar, spinning a convincing tale that anyone bearing the same tattoo was a trusted ally. The dwarves, intrigued but convinced by his earnestness, agreed that if someone ever showed the mark, they’d treat them as a friend of Odric’s.

  

Fate, however, had other plans. A sudden and violent storm wrecked Sorin’s fishing boat on sharp rocks, cutting short the life of Odric Zargrithaz. When Sorin awoke on the island once more, now in the body of a Halfling, he retrieved a hidden pack he’d stashed away in case of such an event. Inside were poorly fitting clothes, basic supplies, and his tattoo kit. He inked the familiar runic swirl onto his new arm before disappearing into the wilderness for weeks, waiting for the right time to reintroduce himself.

  

When the time came, Sorin, now calling himself Bertram Greywater, entered Durak-Tor, carefully timing his visit to the Salted Anvil, Guldrim and Kelvar’s favorite tavern. The dwarves, mourning the loss of Odric, were taken in by Bertram’s lies that he’d traveled to the island to meet his old friend. They quickly warmed to him, and when he revealed the tattoo, their bond with “Odric’s friend” was cemented. Despite this, Sorin felt the growing weight of his deception—though they laughed and drank as they always had, he couldn’t shake the sense of distance his new face and form created.

  

When the dwarves mentioned their need to travel to the wine havens, Sorin saw his chance to leave Durak-Tor behind and avoid the pain of maintaining the charade too long. Requesting to join their journey, the trio set off for the Wine Isles, leaving Bayrock Isle—and the life of Odric Zargrithaz—behind.

# Wine isles backstory

The voyage to the Wine Isles was calm and uneventful, giving Sorin time to reflect as he sailed alongside Guldrim and Kelvar aboard the trade vessel. The pair, ever resourceful, bartered goods with the crew and shared stories of their trading adventures, while Sorin, as Bertram, tried to maintain the illusion of cheerful camaraderie. It was bittersweet for him—he had grown fond of the two dwarves despite the constant reminder that they didn’t truly know him. Still, the weight of his lies made it easier to part ways when they finally docked at Rustfeet, the heart of (thing Rustfeet does).


...they finally docked at Rustfeet, the heart of Winemaking and metalwork within Kazano Depths. 


  

Sorin helped Guldrim and Kelvar unload their goods, the dwarves eagerly trading for wine, spices, and luxuries. After wrapping up business, they shared a final round of drinks at (Tavern name), a (description). When the dwarves announced their departure the next morning, Sorin thanked them sincerely. They handed him a small purse of gold and promised that any friend of Odric Zargrithaz or Bertram Greywater would always be welcome with them.

  

Couple days in rustfeet, acquire a job from Rustfeet npc.

  

Job needs money to get going, ship, crew, ect all need paying. (hire a full crew with a captain). So gets loan/investment from Tebrin Wickroot, npc who's a gnome and probably not a great person to get money from but if the banks won't he will. More details about tebrin.

  

Job goes wrong, investment/thing/pay is lost. Sorin is imprisoned/killed/both. Tebrin is annoyed, wants his money/item/pay back.


Sorin/Bertram gets a job from Khazmok Stouteye to deliver a large shipment of Rustfeet vintage to Andaceres.

Partway through the journey the ship is stopped for an inspection by a Gilded Scales Company vessel, the Sternhammer. While all of the papers were being thoroughly checked, unusual dog-like creatures began bursting from some of the crates you were transporting and attacking the Gilded Scales, as well as your own men. A lot of men are lost in the chaos, but you survive. You are hauled onto the Sternhammer in chains and brought to Alegria Keep, where you have been kept in a cell for two days. They seem to believe you were in some way responsible for the dog-creatures attack.
  

Lead into campaign.
