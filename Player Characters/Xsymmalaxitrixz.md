Backstory (TL;DR)

Xsymmalaxitrixz is a yuan-ti malison of 25-30 years of physical maturity and only 4-ish years of memory - her life before she ascended is a wound in her memory that she pretends doesn’t trouble her. After training in blood magic, alchemy, and the art of combat among the Coils of Ydersius, she developed the sanguine alchemy of hemocraft, but her research was declared heretical and she was ousted as an apostate before she had the chance to experiment on anyone but herself. She tried to flee to the Gilded Scales, but was betrayed and left for dead.

  

Her Blood Hunter hemocraft abilities are a unique mixture of sangromancy (blood magic) and alchemy. Ydersian sangromancy is a powerful and addictive technique - the more she uses it, the more she thinks it can solve all her problems; a potentially intentional side effect to keep Ydersian mystics bound to the Coils. Her interests lie in developing more alchemical mutagens and sangromantic rites that will prove the veracity of her “next stage in the endless chase biological perfection”.

  

Xym is an unusual Ydersian in that she holds very little regard for the cult itself or their celestial end-game of returning Ydersius to the world. Instead, she believes (or at least tries to convince herself) that yuan-ti are physically superior entities and the conversion of other mortals into yuan-ti is simply a beneficial evolution for all involved - why wouldn’t anyone want to become a snake, it’s common sense? Betrayed and outcast, she believes the Coils have stagnated and grown complacent - perfection is a horizon that must always be chased, rather than the supposed end state of the Tlatoani.

## Backstory

Xsymmalaxitrixz’s first memory is that of pain and exaltation; awakening in one of the subterranean Ascension Pools beneath New Sydrixus, she was quickly led from the expended blood pit and evaluated by a mystic she instinctively identified as a Xoani. Bereft of memory and purpose, her instincts nevertheless told her other things: she belonged to the Coils of Ydersius; her biological purity had advanced to the rank of malison; she possessed a talent for the alchemical sciences; and she desperately wished to understand what had happened to her. The Xoani gave her a name and a role, and sent her for education in the ways of the Coils.

  

Her first few months of new life was spent among the Teoxilit, creating alchemical concoctions from healing potions to bespoke narcotics. She had a fascination not just with Ydersian alchemy, but also the physiologies and cultures of the “lesser species” to whom many of their concoctions were being discreetly marketed, and applied this knowledge to make unorthodox - yet effective - improvements to their formulas. She was swiftly inducted into the mysteries of sangromancy - the painfully addictive blood magic of the Coils used to enhance the biological purity of the yuan-ti and the lesser species. 

  

Her next years were marked by escalating conflict in and around New Sydrixus - increased slave raids against the lesser species, coupled with fiendish incursions and rampaging mutants from the heart of the Sydrixian jungle. It is possible that Xsymmalaxitrixz would have joined the mystic acolytes of the Xoani, however due to her enhanced speed and strength as a malison, she was instead given combat training and attached as a battlefield alchemist to the Ydersian soldiers. Her knowledge of xenobiology grew, but she never lost her fascination with the secret magic that had transformed her into what she was. She began to experiment with coupling sangromancy and science - a new form of blood alchemy she has dubbed “hemocraft”.

  

Approaching the fourth year post her ascension as a malison, she perfected a concoction she dubbed The Hunter’s Bane, an alchemical formula that would alter a yuan-ti’s physiology, granting them enhanced sensitivity to otherworldly powers and increasing their blood’s conductivity to magic. With this, any Ydersian officer of passing intellect could be taught to wield hemocraft, and with further refinement Xsymmalaxitrixz was sure that new blood magic rituals could be developed, ascending the yuan-ti race to new heights; greater speed, sharpened senses, vat-grown sorcery… the possibilities, she believed, were endless. The Tlakit she served disagreed, seizing her research and declaring her a heretic, and banishing her from the Coils.

  

Xsymmalaxitrixz has spent the past month running. Though she mourns the loss of her community, research, and purpose, she is not terribly troubled by the brand of apostasy; to her, the Ydersian creed only served to provide a spiritual justification for the obvious truth, that mortal life would be ultimately better off with the superior adaptations of the yuan-ti. She consoles herself that now she can gain more firsthand experience of the lesser races, and with this knowledge better convince them to accept purification. Without her equipment and notes however, she cannot replicate the Hunter’s Bane, and nor can she easily sooth the itch within her blood - the demand to be unleashed in sangromantic power. Knowing that the Coils traded with the Gilded Scales, Xsymmalaxitrixz made haste for one of their merchant vessels to barter her expertise for the tools she needed, however the captain, not wishing to displease his trading partners, slit her throat.

  

Betrayed and left for dead, Xsymmalaxitrixz now finds herself imprisoned, upon the brink of a new adventure…

## Background NPCs

### [[Xoani Tematlan]]

The Xoani mystic who oversaw Xsymmalaxitrixz’s transformation into a malison and integration into the Coils of Ydersius, Tematlan is possibly one of the only yuan-ti who knows who and what she was before her ascension, and this knowledge bothers Xym more than it should. They are a cold, dispassionate psionic who serves Svitram Xiomara as something of a minister for public infrastructure within New Sydrixus.

### [[Tlakit Sthennelaxis]]

Sthennelaxis was Xym’s direct superior within the Coils of Ydersius, leading the detachment of soldiers to which Xym was assigned as battlefield alchemist. When Xym presented her research on the Hunter’s Bane and the improvements it could make to their soldiers, Sthennelaxis was incensed, ordering Xym’s research to be seized and for the apostate herself to be arrested.

### [[Teoxilit Xeokt]]

A formerly-aarakocra pureblood, Xeokt was the closest thing to a friend Xym could have claimed in the Ydersian military. A hunter and scout by role, Xeokt taught Xym how to fight with a bow, and always kept her informed of any interesting flora or fauna in the nearby area. In combat, Xeokt would flank the enemy from behind, sowing confusing with a hail of arrows before vanishing into the jungle; a technique Xym is curious to improve upon.

### [[Xilit Peffee Copsi]]

A halfling Xilit in New Sydrixus, Peffee was a menial assigned to the laboratories where Xsymmalaxitrixz began her journey, and was the first to shorten her name to Xym. Having been captured from the newly-established Freewind Flotilla, he became Xym’s primary source of information on the cultures of the Wine Isles; she particularly delighted in his tales of pirates and the Hurricane Kings. When Xym began her experiments into hemocraft, Peffee unwillingly became her first and most prized test subject. While she lamented (in her own way) the discomfort and pain she caused him, she promised him that he would be the herald of a new age - the next step upon the evolution of yuan-ti perfection. Now banished from the Coils, Xym regrets that she was not able to bring him with her.

### [[Captain Samuel Sartori]]

Captain of the Gilded Scales merchant vessel, the Heron’s Wing, Sartori’s skill as a swordsman raises questions about his past not easily answered by the life of a simple trader he leads. A close trading partner of New Sydrixus, known to Xsymmalaxitrixz from her days manufacturing narcotics as part of the Coils’ foreign destabilisation programme. Sartori refused to give aid to the fleeing malison, instead cutting her throat and tossing her overboard as “a show of good faith” to his partners.**
