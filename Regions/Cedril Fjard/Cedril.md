Cedril, the only settlement on the Island of Bogo, is a lively port village that welcomes all—sailors, pirates, and merchants alike. The town is known for its eccentric tavern, The Worn Sailor (or whatever nickname locals decide to use), whose sign is so weathered that no one knows its original name. The tavern's walls are lined with portraits of past owners, including the famed bartender Toben "The Tumbler" Driftfoot, who left for the city after gaining fame for his exquisite cocktails. One of Cedril's more unusual landmarks is Lamps Eternal, a grand lamp shop teetering on the brink of bankruptcy after an ill-advised business gamble. Its owner, Crelwyn Tannick, still insists that lamps are the future and offers "buy one, get three free" deals to anyone willing to take them. The island itself is mostly untamed, covered in dense woods. At its northeastern point lies an old fort, now a refuge for outlaws and vagabonds who live by their own brutal code. The fort, known as Briarhold, is a lawless place ruled by strength and cunning, making Cedril's loose laws seem downright civilized.
