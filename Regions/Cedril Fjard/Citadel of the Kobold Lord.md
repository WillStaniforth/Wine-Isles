The Citadel of Obaran was once the imposing seat of power for the dragonborn warlord Obaran and his kobold followers. The structure, a towering stone edifice with dragon-shaped spires, now serves as the northernmost embassy of the dragonborn empire. Though part of the citadel is actively used as an embassy, most of its vast chambers remain abandoned, shrouded in dust and mystery. Locals speak of hidden vaults filled with treasures Obaran left behind, guarded by traps and kobold constructs.
