Dunwich is a thriving town nestled in the shadow of the mountains. Its strategic position makes it a crossroads for trade, with wagons arriving daily from Tenford, Gonosz, and beyond. The cliffs deny the town direct access to the ocean, but an intricate system of pulleys and ropes—known locally as "The Spool"—allows goods to be transported from cliffside platforms to the beach below. Dunwich is renowned for Elvyn's Courier Service, an efficient and well-loved delivery company run entirely by halflings who traverse the treacherous mountain roads with remarkable agility. The service's founder, Elvyn, now an adventurer, left the business in the hands of his capable cousin, Piprick "Pipple" Featherfoot.
