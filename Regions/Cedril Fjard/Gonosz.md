A village steeped in natural beauty, Gonosz was founded by elven worshippers of Gozreh. The town is characterized by its elegant wooden structures that blend seamlessly with the surrounding forest. Over time, Gonosz has grown into a multicultural haven, though it retains much of its elven heritage. Central to the village is the Shrine of Gozreh, a serene grove encircled by ancient oaks where both prayers and offerings to the sea and sky are made.
