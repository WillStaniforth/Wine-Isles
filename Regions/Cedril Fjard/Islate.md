This isolated port village is a hidden gem tucked away from the main trade routes. Surrounded by rugged mountains, Islate thrives primarily through its connection to the sea. The Mountain Tunnel, a marvel of dwarven engineering, connects Islate to the greater Wayfield region, allowing trade to flow despite the village's remote location. Islate is renowned for its seafood, particularly its Fireglow lobster, whose shells shimmer like embers and whose meat is considered a delicacy. The village's main inn, The Singing Seal, is a cozy refuge for travelers, with walls adorned with maps of long-forgotten pirate routes and the wreckage of a legendary ship's mast. Despite its picturesque setting, Islate has a somber undertone. Many of its residents have lost family to the sea, and a stone monument by the harbor lists the names of the lost.
