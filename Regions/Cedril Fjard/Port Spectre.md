Once a haven for smugglers, Port Specter has evolved into a legitimate trade hub. The port consists of weathered wooden docks and a scattering of ramshackle homes for sailors who call it their off-sea refuge. While it primarily serves Tenford and Dunwich, Port Specter is also a waypoint for merchants transporting goods across the coastline. A small shipyard here, run by the eccentric dwarven craftsman Garrik Saltiron, repairs and builds vessels. A lively tavern called The Salty Widow draws sailors and travelers alike, offering strong drink and tall tales of sea monsters and hidden treasure.
