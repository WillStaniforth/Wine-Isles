**1st Floor**
***1A - Commodore Valverde's Quarters***
*This cold stone room is sparsely decorated with trophies from a life of combat. A bearskin rug across the floor, a set of crossed sabres on the wall above the writing desk, and certificates showing the rises in rank of one Commodore Valverde.*

The sabres are ***animated shortswords***, and will attack a creature 

***1B*** - Balcony Access
*An bare stone room connects the balcony to three adjoining rooms. A small table with a stool is set in one corner. A guard stood by one of the doors stands alert, and moves to engage.*

There is a ***Gilded Scales Guard*** in this room, and will attack any who enter. If the fight is looking bad, he will call for backup.


***1C - Archon Coliana's Quarters***
*This lavish bedroom is neatly kept, with a four-post bed and a wardrobe carved with hummingbirds, both against the eastern wall. A rug embroidered with a decorative sea monster furnishes the otherwise stone floor. A wooden desk curves around the western wall, obviously crafted for this room. A handful of letters and scrolls sit on the desk, with stacks of books on one side. The most obvious object on the desk is an ornate silver sphere made of numerous concentric circles.* 

Letter 1:
Addressed to Archon Coliana from [[Captain Ludovico Toussant]]:
"Esteemed Archon Coliana,

I trust that this letter will reach you well. It is good to have such an esteemed Archon sent by the Archmage himself to the region. Since Archon Ramos left to pursue his pet project, I'm afraid our research has begun to slow. 

On that topic, I must sincerely thank you for retrieving the device from the loathsome scum that spat at my offer of mercy. See to it that she suffers a gruesome fate for me. 

The device itself is one [[Archon Ramos]] took to calling the 'Gravitic Dweomer'. We had not yet begun to unveil its mysteries, but from my limited research and my sketches, the Archon believes it may have been some ancient precursor to arton-powered flight. Naturally, we would wish it returned to us at [[Storm's Eye Spire]]. 

As such we reach the crux of the matter; the gravitic dweomer must be returned to the spire. And I would wish you to join us here as well. We are in need of a new Archon to guide us and our research. With the gravitic dweomer and the right mind to unlock it's secrets, we could usher in a new age of airships and truly be able to tame the skies of the isles.

Yours sincerely,
Captain Toussant."

Letter 2:
A report of some kind.
"We have followed through on the missing shipments coming through from Andeceres. We have found the wreckage of the Albatross dashed upon the rocks to the north of Kazano Isle. Upon investigation we found signs of a struggle on board, but with no trace of the crew. The ships cargo had also been taken, as have the logbooks. One of my scouts reports seeing a 'strange dog-creature' watching us from about half a mile to the south, but we could not confirm the report."
