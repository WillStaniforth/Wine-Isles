**1st Floor**
***1A - Commodore Valverde's Quarters***
*This cold stone room is sparsely decorated with trophies from a life of combat. A bearskin rug across the floor, a set of crossed sabres on the wall above the writing desk, and certificates showing the rises in rank of one Commodore Valverde.*

The sabres are ***animated shortswords***, and will attack a creature who moves to pick one up without speaking the word "peace". Inside the wardrobe, there is several sets of fancy clothes.

***1B*** - Balcony Access
*An bare stone room connects the balcony to three adjoining rooms. A small table with a stool is set in one corner. A guard stood by one of the doors stands alert, and moves to engage.*

There is a ***Gilded Scales Guard*** in this room, and will attack any who enter. If the fight is looking bad, he will call for backup.


***1C - Archon Coliana's Quarters***
*This lavish bedroom is neatly kept, with a four-post bed and a wardrobe carved with hummingbirds, both against the eastern wall. A rug embroidered with a decorative sea monster furnishes the otherwise stone floor. A wooden desk curves around the western wall, obviously crafted for this room. A handful of letters and scrolls sit on the desk, with stacks of books on one side. The most obvious object on the desk is an ornate silver sphere made of numerous concentric circles.* 

Letter 1:
Addressed to Archon Coliana from [[Captain Ludovico Toussant]]:
"Esteemed Archon Coliana,

I trust that this letter will reach you well. It is good to have such an esteemed Archon sent by the Archmage himself to the region. Since Archon Ramos left to pursue his pet project, I'm afraid our research has begun to slow. 

On that topic, I must sincerely thank you for retrieving the device from the loathsome scum that spat at my offer of mercy. See to it that she suffers a gruesome fate for me. 

The device itself is one [[Archon Ramos]] took to calling the 'Gravitic Dweomer'. We had not yet begun to unveil its mysteries, but from my limited research and my sketches, the Archon believes it may have been some ancient precursor to arton-powered flight. Naturally, we would wish it returned to us at [[Storm's Eye Spire]]. 

As such we reach the crux of the matter; the gravitic dweomer must be returned to the spire. And I would wish you to join us here as well. We are in need of a new Archon to guide us and our research. With the gravitic dweomer and the right mind to unlock it's secrets, we could usher in a new age of airships and truly be able to tame the skies of the isles.

Yours sincerely,
Captain Toussant."

Letter 2:
A report of some kind.
"We have followed through on the missing shipments coming through from Andeceres. We have found the wreckage of the Albatross dashed upon the rocks to the north of Kazano Isle. Upon investigation we found signs of a struggle on board, but with no trace of the crew. The ships cargo had also been taken, as have the logbooks. One of my scouts reports seeing a 'strange dog-creature' watching us from about half a mile to the south, but we could not confirm the report."

***1D*** - Crew Bunks

*The eastern wall of this room is lined with three fine beds separated by ornate wooden dividers. Each bed has a finely carved wooden chest beneath.*

Each chest contains 16gp, 43sp, and 54cp.

***1E*** - Master-Servant's Bunk

*This cosy room is unusually decorated. One side of the room contains a bed, wardrobe, and all the amenities of a bedroom. The side of the room closest to the door appears more of a glorified closet, with brooms and mops, cleaning supplies, as well as a small larder.*

Cowering beneath the bed is Dain Gustav, the master-servant that serves [[Archon Coliana]]. He has keys to every room on the ground floor and top floor of the keep.

***0A*** - The Courtyard

*It's a hot spring day on the 12th of Shellight, moisture in the air from the sweat of the soldiers as they string the prisoners up one by one. The creak of old wooden boards beneath your feet, and the sounds of the waves crashing from the other side of the high stone wall are almost relaxing as the noose is tied around your necks. You smell the salt in the air as [[Commodore Valverde]] steps out from the castle's keep. The commodore stands in a fine blue jacket, her blood red cloak trailing behind her. With a sharp glance she eyes you one by one, judging you for your sins.*

*"You are each here to day to face punishment for your crimes against the Gilded Scales Company, as is decreed by Malthan law."*

*She turns to the first of you.*

*"Maxwell Esters. You have been found guilty of crime of piracy. The sentence is death."*

*She turns to the next of you.*

*"Burdock. You have been found guilty of the crime of piracy. The sentence is death."*

*She turns to the next of you.*

*"Scamp. You have been found guilty of the crimes of stowing away on a Gilded Scales vessel and theft of an artifact belonging to a naval officer. The sentence is death."*

*She turns to the next of you.*

*"Austin Allegro. You have been found guilty of the crimes of piracy, and attempted bribery a naval officer of the Gilded Scales Company. The sentence is death."*

*She turns to the next of you.*

*"Xsymmalaxitrixz. You have been found guilty of the crime of surviving an official execution. The sentence is death."*

*She turns to the last of you.*

*"Kalitas Verrater. You have been found guilty of the crime of stowing away on a Gilded Scales vessel, breaking and entering, and conspiracy to commit theft."*

*With that, she nods her head to the guard stood at the side, as he reaches out for the trapdoor lever. Before he can pull it, however, a sharp "halt the execution" is heard from above. From a balcony above the door the commodore strode from, another woman steps out through a door. The new arrival carries herself in similar robes, but less uniform and more flowing. As she reaches the balcony's edge, you see her begin to levitate over the railing and down until she hovers about 10 feet away from you. Without the balcony's railing obscuring her you see the chevron on her cloak marking her as an Archon, a position of authority in Maltha and one of the Archwizard Fandrel's own apprentices. In one of her hands, she holds a strange silver sphere formed of concentric metal rings.*

*"I have received word from a good friend that this one is not to be executed this day." She says, gesturing towards Scamp. "Congratulations, rat, you'll live to see another cell. As for the rest of them, they may hang." She flicks her free hand dismissively at the group of you, as she begins to levitate back to her balcony.*

*As she does so, a loud CRACK sound shatters the relative calm of the fortress, before a cannonball crashes through part of the battlement.*

*"Battlestations!" Yells the commodore, as she begins yelling orders to the various soldiers on the walls. Several more cannonsballs are loosed as they begin peppering the castle before one strikes one end of the gallows, sending wood splintering, the executioner flying, and the wooden beam holding up the nooses crashing to the ground. It appears, you might have a chance to live.*

*As the courtyard quickly clears of soldiers, the Archon turns her gaze to a trio grabbing their rifles. "You", she points at one, proffering the silvery sphere, "take this, get it to my office and seal it in the strongbox there. You two, finish them off." she says, gesturing at the group of you, before levitating up over the wall to aid the defence. The two guards look to the group of you and begin to approach, one readying his armblade from it's sheath, the other drawing an unusually crafted pistol...*




***0B*** - Chapel of Abadar

*This small chapel has a bust of a man holding a golden key before him at the far wall, with a small plinth in front of it. A small pile of coins rests on the plinth. A man wearing the robes of a priest of Abadar stands beside it, looking concerned.*

The man is an ***acolyte*** and has the *sanctuary* spell cast upon himself. There are 17gp, 30sp, and 52cp on the plinth.

***0C*** - Guardhouse


***0D*** - Armoury

*This room is lined with weapon racks and armour stands. Unfortunately, this was the first place most of the unarmed guards ran to when the cannon fire started, and not much is left. Within the room there are two sets of leather armour, one chain shirt, two spears, a shortbow and 20 arrows, and four daggers.*


***0E*** - Entrance Hall


***0F*** - Sitting Room


***0G*** - Dining Room
