A quaint, breezy port town where folk of the land live in harmony with folk of the sea. A trench curls its way through the centre of the village, filling and draining with the tides. There is a small amount of farmland surrounding the village, but it is primarily a fishing village. Beyond the outskirts of the town is a dense jungle, overlooked by the Stone Tooth; a lone mountain peak rumoured to have once been an ancient Wine Haven.

A storm blew through and destroyed the town's fishing boats two weeks prior. The town's carpenter is sick with plague, but the town can't afford the funding for a healer.

Three weeks prior, a doctor sailed through aboard the Crow's Song. The crew stayed in the town for a few days, before heading out. While in town, the doctor brought relief for the mayor's ailments. However, the mayor discovered that the crew were members of the Gathering of the Fallen. The mayor chased them out of the town. A week ago, the town received a ransom for the crew of the Crows Song, asking to bring 1000gp to the Red Towers in exchange for their crew and doctor.


***The Sahuagin and Lady Tavern***. 
A small tavern on the west side of the town. Where locals and sailors alike meet for drinks and brawls.

The owner is Ardic Geddye, a 53 year old halfling man, with short curly hair and sunburned skin. 




***Mayor's House.***
Mayor Jacquelyn Grace is a middle-aged human woman, and mayor of Alverfjord. She was once a noble in Andaceres, but as punishment for her crimes was sent to become mayor of the backwater town. She is spiteful by nature, and takes it out on the town. During this time of crisis, she refuses to send aid or pay the ransom for the crew of the Crow's Song.
