A quaint, breezy port town where folk of the land live in harmony with folk of the sea. A trench curls its way through the centre of the village, filling and draining with the tides. There is a small amount of farmland surrounding the village, but it is primarily a fishing village. Beyond the outskirts of the town is a dense jungle, overlooked by the Stone Tooth; a lone mountain peak rumoured to have once been an ancient Wine Haven.

A storm blew through and destroyed the town's fishing boats two weeks prior. The town's carpenter is sick with plague, but the town can't afford the funding for a healer.

Three weeks prior, a doctor sailed through aboard the Crow's Song. The crew stayed in the town for a few days, before heading out. While in town, the doctor brought relief for the mayor's ailments. However, the mayor discovered that the crew were members of the Gathering of the Fallen. The mayor chased them out of the town. A week ago, the town received a ransom for the crew of the Crows Song, asking to bring 1000gp to the Red Towers in exchange for their crew and doctor.

***The Sahuagin and Lady Tavern***. 
A small tavern on the west side of the town. Where locals and sailors alike meet for drinks and brawls.

The owner is Ardic Geddye, a 53 year old halfling man, with short curly hair and sunburned skin. 




***Mayor's House.***
Mayor Jacquelyn Grace is a middle-aged human woman, and mayor of Alverfjord. She was once a noble in Andaceres, but as punishment for her crimes was sent to become mayor of the backwater town. She is spiteful by nature, and takes it out on the town. During this time of crisis, she refuses to send aid or pay the ransom for the crew of the Crow's Song.



***Tolm's Superior Outfitting and Goods.***
Ran by the dwarven smith Kheldegan Tolm, this forge and equipment shop is an excellent stop for travelling ships. Tolm sells weapons, armour, and adventuring equipment at standard rates.



***Carpenter/Shipwright's.***
Tobrin Durgeddin is the dwarven carpenter of the town, along with his two young sons Wubrin and Debrin. Tobrin and his sons have been afflicted with a bloodbound curse of the Durgeddin, caused by their ancestor within Khundrukar. To remove the curse they must drink deep from the Durgeddin reserve, a wine lost within the depths of Khundrukar. The curse was placed in Durgeddin the Black's dying breath, cursing his cousin who had escaped and left Khundrukar to fall. It was his hopes that this curse would force the Durgeddin clan into retaking their fallen home.


***Shrine to Abadar.*** 
Sister Alonsa is in charge of the town's shrine of Abadar, and she was once a member of the Gilded Scales Company before settling down in the town several years ago. 


***Shrine to Gozreh.***
Ran by Kallipos Salakis, a triton priest of Gozreh, this simple shrine is his pride and joy, hand-carved from the stone of the cavern. While the triton of Alverfjord abide by the laws and decisions of the mayor, in recent years they've started looking more towards Kallipos for guidance.

***The Waterway***
Beneath Alverfjord, there is a secondary layer to the village known locally as the Waterway. The waterway was originally founded when Kallipos Salakis led a group of tritons disgruntled with their situation away from the triton dominance of Zakross. The dominance was under threat from an ancient sea monster that had begun demanding more and more sacrifices in it's name. The sovereign of the dominance, Vasilios, was more than happy to send more and more of his people to their deaths while he searched for a new home. The tritons of Zakross are a warlike dominance, and hate the surface dwellers.

The triton of Alverfjord think they spotted a group of Zakrossi tritons searching a couple of miles up the coastline from Alverfjord, and are on high alert. This is not elping the food crisis in Alverfjord.



***Lore on Khundrukar***
Durgeddin was a master smith who forged blades of surpassing quality and power. Centuries ago, his winehaven was sacked by orcs. Durgeddin led the remnants of his clan to the mountains north of the town of Alverfjord and established a small, secret stronghold somewhere in the trackless wilderness.

From his hidden redoubt, he waged a decades-long vendetta against all orc-kind, until his enemies discovered his fortress and attacked it after a long siege. Durgeddin and his followers perished, and much wealth was carried away by the conquering hordes. But it's said that the deepest and best-hidden vaults, armories, and wine cellars escaped the looting, and that some of Durgeddin's extraordinary blades still wait in the darkness for a hand bold enough to claim one.





*Return from the Red Towers*

Upon their arrival back to Alverfjord, the party will find that the Sternhammer is docked and numerous triton are being forced aboard. The townsfolk are audibly unhappy with this, but nobody is stepping up to stop them.
