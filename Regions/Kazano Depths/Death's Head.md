Death's Head is the name of the island volcano south of Kazano isle. The volcano is active, and regularly erupts, spewing lava and pyroclastic ash into the atmosphere. The volcano is the lair of the adult red dragon Ignus Rex, a tyrant who seeks to seize control of the seas. Most of the island is barren volcanic rock, with little being able to survive the environment.

Death's Head is also the name of the settlement of Pirates and Privateers on the southern cliffs of the island. The bay of Death's Head is built beneath a massive rocky overhang from the surrounding cliffs, which protects it from the volcano's eruptions. While this doesn't let in a lot of natural light, the bay is illuminated by a dozen burning braziers built into the cliffside. This gives the bay a gloomy cast, as the firelight flickers. Seastacks formed of cooling lava that has dripped from the overhang form pillars that rise out from the ocean, criss-crossed by wooden bridges and metal platforms. The ramshackle buildings are built atop these platforms, with the port stretching wide and tall beneath the canopy. The bay itself is hidden by unusual rock formations that have formed from lava cooling.

The settlement is policed by hundreds of red kobolds, who enjoy a sense of power over the pirates that make port. They keep the rule of law for Ignus Rex, and collect his tithes. Ships are charged 100gp upon arrival at Death's Head for the privilege. This is taken directly to the dragon's hoard via kobolds.



Locations:

Crimson Maw Arena

In the centre of the bay, halfway up the cliffside, is the Crimson Maw arena. This structure sits atop a wide and squat seastack, and is one of few buildings wrought of metal. The arena most often pits warriors who fight until surrender, but will occasionally throw captured Gilded Scales or Servants of the Light in against ferocious beasts as a form of execution.


Scavenged Sundries

Built into a cliffside cave on the innermost wall of the bay, scavenged sundries is a shop that sells all sorts of unusual bits and bobs and is the place to go to for magic items. The shop is run by a crew of awakened undead that scour the seabed around wrecks to search for treasure that's gone down with a ship. The three that run the shop go by Tom, Dick, and Harry.

They sell a small selection of magic items, which change weekly.

Belly of the Beast

The second largest building, only to the Crimson Maw, is the Belly of the Beast. Floating between the seastacks and accessible through rigging, it is an old galleon that has been permanently moored and converted into a large tavern. It is ran by a dwarven woman known as Galtian Margie. Galtian Margie is a middle-aged black woman with long wavy hair and dresses in fancy suits. She is a very no-nonsense person who doesn't like people causing trouble for her or treating her without respect.

28 years ago, Galtian Margie, then known as Margorie Ruduvin, was part of an Octopus Guild revolt that tried to seize power within the guild and through that, Jakhammer as a whole. Austin Allegro betrayed this, which she sees as the reason the plan failed. 
She fled to the coast of Vycus and laid low in a coastal city for the next decade. In this time, she rose to a position of power in the docks of this city, becoming harbourmaster whilst running an illegal gambling ring. During this time, the city was attacked by the current Hurricane King who plundered the city with his fleet. 
Margorie was taken captive, but convinced the pirates to spare her. She then worked her way up over the next 6 years to become captain of the Belly of the Beast. She captained for another 6 years, before the ship ran aground at Death's Head whilst trying to plunder the hoard of Ignus Rex.
Once again, Margorie used her skills of persuasion to convince the dragon of an alternative arrangement. She convinced him that a piratical bay here would bring the dragon far more gold than his raids on ships that come nearby. This is considered the founding of Death's Head.
