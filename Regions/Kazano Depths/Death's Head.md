Death's Head is the name of the island volcano south of Kazano isle. The volcano is active, and regularly erupts, spewing lava and pyroclastic ash into the atmosphere. The volcano is the lair of the adult red dragon Ignus Rex, a tyrant who seeks to seize control of the seas. Most of the island is barren volcanic rock, with little being able to survive the environment.

Death's Head is also the name of the settlement of Pirates and Privateers on the southern cliffs of the island. The bay of Death's Head is built beneath a massive rocky overhang from the surrounding cliffs, which protects it from the volcano's eruptions. While this doesn't let in a lot of natural light, the bay is illuminated by a dozen burning braziers built into the cliffside. This gives the bay a gloomy cast, as the firelight flickers. Seastacks formed of cooling lava that has dripped from the overhang form pillars that rise out from the ocean, criss-crossed by wooden bridges and metal platforms. The ramshackle buildings are built atop these platforms, with the port stretching wide and tall beneath the canopy. The bay itself is hidden by unusual rock formations that have formed from lava cooling.

The settlement is policed by hundreds of red kobolds, who enjoy a sense of power over the pirates that make port. They keep the rule of law for Ignus Rex, and collect his tithes. Ships are charged 100gp upon arrival at Death's Head for the privilege. This is taken directly to the dragon's hoard via kobolds.

In the centre of the bay, halfway up the cliffside, is the Crimson Maw arena. This structure sits atop a wide and squat seastack, and is one of few buildings wrought of metal.
