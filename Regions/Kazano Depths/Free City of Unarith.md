The City of Unarith is ruled over by the three merchant lords from the Four Sage Stand. The current lords are:
* Enyra Xennis - A beaurocratic Elven woman who takes her role as a merchant lord very seriously. She is up for re-election this year, and is looking for an opportunity to prove her worth after a disaster she was involved with last year.
* Thundercloud in the Night - A panthera tabaxi that is accustomed to a lavish lifestyle and living large. He is a cunning trader, but can be rather lazy in-person. He prefers to do all his trade from the luxury of his rooms within the Four Sage Stand.
* Mili Coalbraids - An extremely hard working and tough dwarven woman. She is not afraid to get her hands dirty, and is often seen at the docks inspecting cargo flowing in and out of the city.




Letter to Marbin Roseblossom

"Dearest Marbin Roseblossom,

You are cordially invited to dine with Thundercloud in the Night within the Four Sage Stand atop the Free City of Unarith. His lordship has benefitted from your trade over the past two years, and wishes to finally meet his esteemed trade partner in person.

Formal attire is required from yourself and your retinue. Upon your arrival in the Free City of Unarith, show this letter to the harbourmaster and he will make the arrangements with me. You will be housed and fed, and your dinner with Thundercloud in the Night will occur within 6 days of your arrival.

Yours sincerely,
High Vizier Draum"
