An unusual island to the south-west of Secinia Abyssal, Devil's Cay is locked in a perpetual winter. In the caverns beneath the island, an ice devil by the name of Bavrazi is bound, straining for freedom. 

Bavrazi is bound by contract to protect the treasure of Evelina Silver-Teeth (2nd Hurricane King), and must try her hardest to slay any who would take it.

The treasure is in the centre of a Magic Circle which traps Bavrazi. Her only want is for somebody to claim the treasure, and defeat her in combat. The magic circle drops whenever any of the treasure is removed.

When encountered, she will explain that they are free to take the treasure if they wish, but she must fight them to the death to stop it from leaving. She will then return and keep chasing after them until they can kill the party, return the treasure, and return to her torment.
