***Upon Arrival WIthin the Sea of Nightmare Via Death***
Your vision begins to swim, shifting, changing before darkening entirely.

You die.

You feel an awful tearing sensation, as if you were a cloth caught between the jaws of two vicious hounds. You scream, desperately trying to hold yourself together. Your will means nothing. You are rent, ripped, and hurled into a place of endless, shifting shadows like being plunged into icy water. 

A moment passes, and you realise...you are in icy water. After what could be seconds, minutes, or hours, you breach the surface, gasping and aching. 

The shadows seem to withdraw, coalescing into shapes. You feel yourself solidifying, entering this realm fully. Shadows around you form...islands. Small pockets of land floating in this dark ocean, eerily lit in an ethereal green glow from the stars. 



In the eerie darkness, the silhouette of a mountain rises from the ocean to the south of you. Through the fog, a small vessel...rows. About a dozen oars peak from hatches in the side you can see. At the bow of the ship, and unusual pale light glows from a dozen spheres, like an unusual lighthouse. Figures move on deck but too far to make out any detail. One of the beams of light from the bow brushes across you and stops, as the others all turn to illuminate you. From the origin of each light you see an eye. The boat begins to move at speed towards you.

As it approaches, you can see that it wasn't a lantern atop the bow, but a horrifying amalgamation of flesh and eyes easily as tall as three men. To it's side, in grey robes, a familiar ratfolk leers over the side of the ship, a grin on his face. Kez, the self-declared fleshmancer you'd previously sent to an early grave. Just below, you see painted in red on the side of the ship "Carrion Trawler". A dozen lost souls, skeletal remains of sailors amble about the deck.

The eye creature leans down with too-long arms to collect you, but as it does you feel a familiar tugging sensation. You see the grin of the ratfolk turn sour as something pulls you down, and everything fades to black.
