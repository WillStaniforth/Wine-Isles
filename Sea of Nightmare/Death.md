***Upon Arrival WIthin the Sea of Nightmare Via Death***
Your vision begins to swim, shifting, changing before darkening entirely.

You die.

You feel an awful tearing sensation, as if you were a cloth caught between the jaws of two vicious hounds. You scream, desperately trying to hold yourself together. Your will means nothing. You are rent, ripped, and hurled into a place of endless, shifting shadows like being plunged into icy water. 

A moment passes, and you realise...you are in icy water. After what could be seconds, minutes, or hours, you breach the surface, gasping and aching. 

The shadows seem to withdraw, coalescing into shapes. You feel yourself solidifying, entering this realm fully. Shadows around you form...islands. Small pockets of land floating in this dark ocean, eerily lit in an ethereal green glow from the stars. On the horizon...a ship approaches.
